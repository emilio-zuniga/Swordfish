# Tasks

This is a list of early tasks which should probably be implemented in the following order:
- [ ] Represent the board and pieces as a `struct` of bitboards (i.e. `u64` integers).
- [ ] Figure out how we want to generate moves. On the fly, or precomputed and stored?
- [ ] Given a board and player turn, generate all possible moves at that level.
